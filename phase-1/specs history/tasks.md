# Tasks: Todo In-Memory Python API Application - Phase 1

## 1. Project Setup

*   [ ] Create a new Python project.
*   [ ] Set up the project directory structure (e.g., `src`, `tests`).
*   [ ] Initialize a virtual environment.
*   [ ] Create the main application file (`src/main.py`).

## 2. Data Model Implementation

*   [ ] Define the `Task` class to represent a todo task.
*   [ ] Implement methods for creating, accessing, updating, and deleting task data.

## 3. API Implementation

*   [ ] Use the `FastAPI` library to create the API.
*   [ ] Define endpoints for adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as complete/incomplete.
*   [ ] Implement input validation and error handling.

## 4. Business Logic Implementation

*   [ ] Implement the core business logic for each endpoint.
*   [ ] Use the `Task` class to manage task data.
*   [ ] Implement error handling and provide informative messages in the API response.

## 5. Testing

*   [ ] Write unit tests for each endpoint and business logic function.
*   [ ] Use the `pytest` framework for testing.
*   [ ] Ensure that all tests pass before proceeding to the next step.

## 6. Documentation

*   [ ] Write a README file with instructions on how to install and use the API.
*   [ ] Add docstrings to the code.
